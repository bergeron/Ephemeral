                Ephemeral lets you send temporary, encrypted messages.  
                After creating a message, you are given a URL that allows the recipient to read the message.
                The message is destroyed upon being read (or after a set timeout defaulting to 30 days).

                <br><br>
                
                Ephemeral is not a replacement for PGP.  It relies on the recipient being the first person to visit the URL.  Ephemeral is more useful for temporariness than it is encryption.

                <h2>Temporary Messaging</h2>
                The message is sent to the server over SSL.  It is 128 bit AES encrypted with a random key.  The key is sent back to you in a URL, and is never persistently stored on the server.  When the recipient visits the URL the message is decrypted, delivered to the recipient, and deleted.  Because encryption keys are deleted, they exist only in the URL on your clipboard.  Ephemeral cannot decrypt any messages in its database.

                <h2>Password Protection:</h2>
                The message is 128 bit AES encrypted in your browser before it is sent to the server.  Keys are derived from your chosen password with salted PBKDF2.  The server stores only the encrypted message, and never sees the key.  The URL will deliver the encrypted message to the recipient, and it will be decrypted in the recipient's browser.  The message will be deleted.  You are responsible for delivering the key to the recipient through a secure exchange.  This could be done through online chat/message/text/etc or in person.  At NO point can the Ephemeral server know your message.

                <h2>Encrypted chat:</h2>

                RSA is used to exchange a shared secret, by which all messages and nicknames are 128 bit AES encrypted.
